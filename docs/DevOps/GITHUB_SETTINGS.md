# GitHub Settings

The following provides a summary over the settings explicitly configured for the WAVE GitHub repository.

## Issue Templates

GitHub provides Issues as a way for the users to interact with the developer team. The WAVE repository provides templates for [bug reports](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and [feature requests](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_feature.md). This is to standardize and organize the way, in which the users turn in their suggestions and feedback, in order to make processing the different support items easier for the maintainers of the project.

Alongside of this, pull request are the usual way, in which contributions start their way into the repository. To ensure, that the changes of each pull request are properly described, a [pull request template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/new_pull_request.md) is also provided.

## Branch Protection

## Pull Requests

Because of the branch protection rules described above, the only suitable way to push code into the default branch is through pull requests. These are intertwined with a code review process.

TODO

Thsi process is conducted so that

- the author of the pull requests gets meaningful insight and feedback to their contribution
- the code quality is protected through the fresh sets of eyes of the other developers
