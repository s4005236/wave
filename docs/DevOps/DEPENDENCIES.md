# Dependencies
Dependencies refer to all the external libraries, packages, or modules that the project needs to work properly.

## Goal
The goal is to give each module its specific dependencies, while still making it easy to install the requirements of the entire system without too much hassle.

## Structure
- pyproject.tomls for main and submodules
- poetry as packaging dependency manager
- create venv with poetry
